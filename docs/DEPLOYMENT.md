# Deployment

Deployment target: online private deployment.

Possible options:

- Vercel + Supabase
- Railway + Supabase
- Render + Supabase
- Private VPS

Deployment is not part of Sprint 000.

Production requirements:

- environment variables server-side only;
- authentication enabled;
- private uploads;
- audit logs;
- backup/export process.

## Sprint 004 Notes

Sprint 004 establishes the persistence foundation but does not require deployment changes.

The app must continue to run when Supabase is not configured, using mock/session-compatible fallback behavior.

No public file URLs, no client-side Supabase keys, and no direct client writes should be introduced in this sprint.

Production auth and private upload handling remain later-sprint concerns.
